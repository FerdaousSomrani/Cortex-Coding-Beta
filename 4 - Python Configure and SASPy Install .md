SASPy Installation and Configuration
To install the SASPy in your Python Command, you need to ensure that you meet the prerequisite:
1. Java version 1.8.0_162 or higher
2. Python 3.3 or higher
3. SASPy 3.3.4 or higher

Step 1: Install PIP (Windows) You need to open Command Prompt and check your Python version by entering code py --version, if it is higher than 3.4, pip is already installed.
If pip is not installed, you should first try to bootstrap it from the standard library by entering the code py -m ensurepip --default-pip in Command Prompt.
If that still does not allow you to run code python -m pip, you need to download get-pip.py ( https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), and run code python get-pip.py 
in the Command Prompt.
This will install or upgrade pip. Additionally, it will install setup tools and wheel if they are not installed already.
