Now that you have completed Steps 1-4 (ie signed up for SODA etc ) now you can play with Jupyter Notebook 

You can play the game by coding the projection model in Python. You will need to first establish connection between SODA and Python Command in order to access datasets in SAS terminal.

We will provide the baseline model of Python code in Jupyter Notebook. Python players will be expected to install Jupyter Notebook to continue the game.

After you successfully open the Jupyter Notebook, you can download the Python code of the baseline model from Github, you can modify the code to achieve the goal of the game â€“
