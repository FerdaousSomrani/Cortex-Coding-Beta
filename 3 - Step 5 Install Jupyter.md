Now that you have completed Steps 1-4 (ie signed up for SODA etc ) now you can play with Jupyter Notebook 

You can play the game by coding the projection model in Python. You will need to first establish connection between SODA and Python Command in order to access datasets in SAS terminal.

We will provide the baseline model of Python code in Jupyter Notebook. Python players will be expected to install Jupyter Notebook to continue the game. We recommend using Anaconda to do this.

After you successfully open the Jupyter Notebook, you can set up and install the SAS Py and connect to SAS On Demand for Academics
